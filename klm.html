Though a guided walk is provided here through the park, the guide himself didn't seem to be very knowledgeable either about the butterflies or the host plants. Various host plants, specific for specific flies are planted here to attract them. The number of flies and chances of seeing them depend up on the time of the day and the season. The whole walk takes about an hour. Though it is claimed to be an Educational tour, didn't seem like one. </p>
